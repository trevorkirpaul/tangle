# Tangle

**Description:** A social network app that focuses on simplicity.

I'm creating this app so I can use `Test Driven Development`. I've set up Jest and Enzyme to work with CRA using non-default settings. I also want to have true authentication in this app, using JWT mainly.

**Goals:** I'm hoping to gain a much better understanding of testing in general and I believe TTD will make my dev process much more complete. It will definitely be hard work at first, since testing with React can be daunting. It will definitely pay of and I hope to have this small project completed before ~~January 24th~~.

Since my focus is to get comfortable with testing, the app itself will be incredibly simple. The features I definitely plan on having are:

1. Account creation
2. Authenticated Sign In
3. Authenticated Profile updates
4. Users can create posts and comment on other user posts
5. Users can delete their posts or their comments

Most of this will involve saving JWT to localStorage and in Redux then sending the token to be authenticated on each action.

Styling hasn't been decided yet. I could go with a very simple component library if I can find one or stick with my own styling.

I'm looking forward to this project and hopefully it will showcase a more professional and planned side of my skill set.

I've been trying to implement tests for my actions but it's proven to be too complex. It doesn't help that I'm starting with actions where I'm using thunk...or just testing redux in general.

I have a udemy course where I can review testing in detail. It's a section that I previously skipped and it should only take one day to complete if I focus.

This project is on hiatus until I complete that section.
